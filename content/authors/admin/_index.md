  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me
I am a cryptographer at NTT, where I have been working since 1992. My introduction to public-key cryptography came from Tatsuaki Okamoto, sparking a career focused on cryptographic primitives and protocols. Over the years, I have had the privilege of visiting Prof. Ueli Maurer's group at ETH Zurich in 1996 and the Crypto Group at IBM Watson, led by Tal Rabin, in 2004—both experiences were inspiring and transformative. Since 2013, I have also been affiliated with Kyoto University, where I lead the Abe-Tibouchi Laboratory (formerly the Okamoto-Abe Laboratory) and collaborate with motivated students on a wide range of research topics in cryptography.

A bit about my personal life. I live and work in the western part of Tokyo. Love to listen to piano music, and tweak my tube audio. Grow plants in the balcony. Addicted to coffee.
